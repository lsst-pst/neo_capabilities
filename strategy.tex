As deployed and funded (by the U.S National Science Foundation and
Department of Energy), LSST is primarily a science-driven mission. 
Existing cadence is optimized to maximize the overall science returns
(incl. Solar System science), rather than NEO/PHA discovery
completeness (though the two goals are highly interrelated).  As designed, the survey is not optimized for rapid
discovery and follow-up of all types of moving objects\footnote{
XXX What's the purpose of this footnote? Note that LSST will enable rapid identification and follow-up of
trailed objects (within 60 seconds of discovery). If deployed with a 
planetary-defense optimized cadence, the NEO yields could be
significantly improved, and approaching the 90\% completeness level
for $H<22$.} 
Early simulations indicate 90\% is achievable for NEO-optimized
cadence. However, other science goals would be affected (including
Solar System science!).  XXX Refer to Jones et al.  (2016) 

The current baseline cadence is optimized for science returns.
It is expected to yield approximately $\sim$70\% of the extant NEO population.
