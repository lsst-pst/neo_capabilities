astro_lsst_01_1015:
- the best (but only about half of WFD visits due to 60 sec exposures) 
- how about 20 deg band around the Ecliptic? Going from 12 to 15 has a
    big impact.
- 3 pairs in 30 days at SNR=4 should be similar in completeness to 3
    pairs in 15 days at SNR=3, but more doable

- at the bright end (H<20), C for single detection and single pair
   saturates at ~99.4%; this shows that 12-year survey is long enough
   to get even those objects that can ``hide behind the Sun'' 
- 3 pairs in 15 nights with SNR=0 results in C=96.4%; this shows that 
   the impact of finite cadence on completeness for *large* objects is 
   only 3.0%
- 3 pairs in 15 nights with SNR=5 gives C=75%, which compared to 
   a single detection with SNR=5 and C=93% represents a loss of 18%;
   therefore, the impact of cadence on *small* objects is much larger 
   than for large objects; going from a single detection to 3 pairs in
   15 nights is equivalent to losing 2 mag of depth! 
- 3 pairs in 15 nights with SNR=5 crosses C=90% at H~20.5; data 
   deeper by 1.5 mag would bring H<22 completeness to 90% (or we'd
   need to go to SNR=1.3); but to go deeper by 1.5 mag, the exposure 
   time needs to be 16 times longer!! 
- going from 15 nights to 30 nights boosts C by 4.4%; this is
   equivalent to about 0.3 mag deeper data and 1.2 mag of ``missing''
   depth; in this case, the exposure time would have to be ``only'' 9
   times longer to reach C=90% for H<22. 
   
So, reaching C=90% is becoming more and more hopeless. My last 
desperate traces of hope are: 
- we could look at the median brightness of (say) H=22 objects vs.
   ecliptic latitude (and perhaps solar elongation to account for
   sweet spots) and adjust exposure time as a function of latitude 
   (we know that the faintest H=22 detections are close to the
   Ecliptic)
- if the required band width is much less than 15 deg, we would 
   perhaps have enough observing time budget to really go with 5-10
   minutes long exposures. Of course, we'd have to keep them down
   to 1 min or so and shift-and-coadd multiple exposures for a grid
   of possible motions, which would be a major impact on DM 
- we could look at H~22 objects which we missed with 3 pairs in 15
   nights, but which we did *not* miss with ``single detection'' and
   ask what were their SNRs when they were in the FOV but didn't 
   have SNR>5. And where they were on the sky. This sounds like 
   something for Joachim to look at. 
- NASA says ``we'd be happy with even C=80%"  :)

TODO from May 29 reading: 
- ref to Chesley & JPL, find his simulations plan
- in Introduction, add info about counts of transients from my AAS

10 km/s at 100 Lunar Distances is:
384,000 km * ang. speed (radian/s)  = 10 km/s 
ang. speed = 5.4 arcsec / sec  = 5.4 * 3600 * 24 arcsec / day   = 5.4*24 ~ 100 deg/day 
5.4 arcsec/sec * 30 sec ~ 3 arcmin trail! 


The impact of trailing: for 0.8 arcsec seeing and 30 sec exp (tau=1) 
slow: 0.25 deg/day, fast: 1 deg/day

2.0    0.38         0.25              1.26               0.10              0.48

Optimal (trailed) vs. PSF detection for v=1 deg/day is worth 0.13 mag
for nominal exposures, and 0.23 mag for 60 sec exposures (0.15 mag
for v=0.25 deg/day). Adopting 0.2 mag for doubling exposure time, 
this corresponds to about 0.02 in completeness.
