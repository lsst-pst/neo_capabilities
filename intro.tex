\section{Introduction}

The small-body populations in the Solar System, such as asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)
and comets, are remnants of its early assembly. Collisions in the main asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter still occur, and occasionally eject objects on orbits that may place them on a collision course
with Earth. About 20\% of this near-Earth Object (NEO) population, the so-called potentially hazardous
asteroids (PHAs), are in orbits that pass sufficiently close to Earth's orbit, to within 0.05 AU, that
perturbations with time scales of a century can lead to intersections and the possibility of collision.
In order to improve quantitative understanding of this hazard, in December 2005 the U.S. Congress
directed\footnote{National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-155), January 4, 2005, Section 321, George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act} NASA to implement a NEO survey that
would catalog 90\% of NEOs with diameters larger than 140 meters by 2020 (known as the George
E. Brown, Jr. mandate). It is estimated that there are about 20,000 such objects (XXX need reference!).
For a compendium of additional information about NEOs and PHAs and an up-to-date summary of
discovery progress, see NASA's NEO webpage\footnote{http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/}.

The completeness level set by the Congressional mandate could be accomplished with a 10-meter-class
ground-based optical telescope, equipped with a multi-gigapixel camera and a sophisticated and robust data
processing system \citep[see NASA-commissioned reports by ][]{stokes03,shapiro10}. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\footnote{www.lsst.org} (LSST), currently being
constructed, is such a system. A concise LSST system description, discussion of science drivers, and other
information, are available in \cite{LSSToverview}. The LSST baseline strategy for discovering Solar System
objects is predicated on two observations of the same field per night, spaced by a few tens of minutes, and
a revisit of the same field with another pair of observations within a few days. The main reason for two
observations per night is to help association of observations of the same object from different nights,
as follows. Typical distance between two nearby asteroids on the Ecliptic, at the faint fluxes probed by
LSST, is a few arcminutes (counts are dominated by main-belt asteroids). Typical asteroid motion
during several days is larger (of the order a degree or more) and thus, without additional information,
detections of individual objects are ``scrambled''. However, with two detections per night, the motion
vector can be estimated. The motion vector makes the linking problem much easier because
positions from one night can be approximately extrapolated to future (or past) nights. The predicted
position's uncertainty is typically of the order of several arcminutes, rather than a degree, which effectively
``de-scrambles'' detections from different nights (for a detailed discussion of this algorithm, see
Appendix~\ref{sec:appMOPS}).

Early simulations of LSST performance presented by \cite{IvezicNEO2007} showed that the 10-year baseline
cadence would result in 75\% completeness for PHAs greater than 140 m (more  precisely, for PHAs with
$H<22$; see \S\ref{sec:GMS} for further discussion). They also suggested that with additional optimization of the
observing cadence, LSST could achieve 90\% completeness. An example of such an optimization was discussed
by \cite{LSSToverview} who reported that, to reach 90\% completeness, about 15\% of observing time would
have to be dedicated to NEOs, and the survey would have to run for 12 years.
%% From the overview paper:
%% - the LSST baseline cadence provides orbits for 82% of PHAs larger than 140 meters after 10 years of operations
%% - 84% completeness with minor changes to the cadence (5% of time for NEO-optimized observations)
%% - 90% completeness with major changes to the cadence (15% of time for NEO-optimized observations and 12 years)
The latest LSST simulation results, presented in \cite{JJI2016}, yielded a completeness of $\sim$72\% for
PHAs with $H<22$, using the current 10-year baseline survey. The minor differences in reported completeness
compared to older LSST studies are attributable to differences in simulated NEO populations and other modeling
details (such as improved hardware understanding).

These completeness estimates are based on an implicit assumption that 3 pairs of observations
obtained within a 15-30 day wide window are sufficient to recognize that these observations belong
to the same object, and to estimate its orbital parameters (the same criterion has been used in NASA
studies\footnote{See http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html}).
This so-called linking of individual detections into plausible orbital tracks will be performed using a
special-purpose code named Moving Object Processing Software (MOPS). The MOPS software system and its
algorithms are significantly more advanced than anything previously fielded for this purpose.

The described LSST strategy for discovering moving objects has been questioned (e.g., \citealt{GMS2016}) on
two grounds:
\begin{itemize}
\item A large number of false detections due to problems with image differencing software may
make linking problem prohibitively hard for MOPS. In particular, this objection is motivated by the experience
from extant surveys, such as Pan-STARRS and the Catalina Sky Survey.
\item Modifications of LSST baseline cadence, including image depth, sky coverage and cadence,
required to reach 90\% completeness level, have not yet been explicitly demonstrated using detailed
operations simulations, and made available to the community.
\end{itemize}
We aim to address these critiques here: the two major questions addressed by our study can be informally
stated as ``Will MOPS work?'' and ``If MOPS works, what fraction of  NEOs will LSST discover?''.

We use a combination of sophisticated simulations and real datasets to address these questions.
The main analysis components presented here include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Analysis of the performance of prototype LSST image differencing software, with emphasis on the rate and
    properties of false detections (so-called ``false positives''), using DECam (XXX add ref.) imaging data.
\item Analysis of the linking of asteroid detections in the presence of a large number of false positives, using MOPS
         and simulated observations.
\item Analysis of a large number of modified observing cadence simulations, coupled with NEO population
          models, to forecast discovery rates.
\end{enumerate}

We demonstrate that i) MOPS can cope with anticipated false detection rates
in LSST difference images, and that ii) NEO discovery performance of the LSST baseline cadence
can be appreciably boosted by adequate modifications of the observing strategy.
In \S2 we provide a brief overview of LSST and its strategy for discovering moving Solar
System objects. We discuss the performance of prototype LSST image differencing pipeline
in \S3, and MOPS performance in \S4. Modifications of the baseline cadence designed to
boost NEO/PHA completeness are described in \S5, and our results are summarized and
discussed in \S6.
