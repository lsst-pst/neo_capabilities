\section{LSST Observing Cadence Optimization to Enhance PHA Completeness}


XXX Lynne: describe here new OpSim runs. 


The leading systematic effects in completeness estimates are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item NEO vs. PHA difference (the completeness is about $\sim$5\% higher for PHAs than for NEOs) 
\item Different sample definitions: $H<22$ vs. $D>140$m (as shown by \citep{GMS2016}, completeness
           increases by $\sim$5\% when $H$-based criterion is used) 
\item Orbital parameter distribution for the simulated asteroid population (e.g. the Bottke model
             vs. the Granvik model; varying populations contribute completeness uncertainty of a few percent) 
\item Variations of ``discovery window'' (e.g., X visit pairs in N nights: changing N from 15 to 30 with X=3 increases
          completeness by 3\%; changing X from 3 to 4 with N=15 decreases completeness by 6\%). 
\item Variations of the nominal detection threshold (if the detection threshold is changed from the 
          signal-to-noise ratio of 5 or greater to 4 or greater, the completeness is boosted by 2-3\%; 
          the difference between the optimal detection using trailed profile and point-spread-function 
          detection, which is negligible for LSST baseline exposure time of 30 seconds, would be worth 2\%
          in completeness for doubled exposure time). 
\item Sensitivity to details in sky coverage and cadence (e.g. nightly pairs of visits vs. quads of visits;
          requiring quads instead of pairs of visits decreases completeness by 30\% using baseline cadence; 
          about half of that loss can be recovered using cadence simulations that request four visits per night) 
\item Uncertainties when predicting effective image depth (system throughput, variation of the detection efficiency
          with the signal-to-noise ratio, treatment of trailing losses); for a survey that has a completeness above 60\%, 
          each additional one magnitude of depth for a given survey cadence increases the completeness by another 10\%.
\item Uncertainties when predicting apparent flux (albedo distribution, phase effects, photometric variability 
          due to non-spherical shapes, color distributions); assuming an uncertainty of 0.2 mag in the effective 
          limiting magnitude, the corresponding  systematic uncertainty in completeness is about 2\%.)
\item The slope of the asteroid size distribution (current measurement uncertainty of this parameter 
          corresponds to a systematic uncertainty in completeness of about 2\%.)
\item The impact of known objects (assuming that 43\% objects would be discovered by the start of
          LSST survey, \citep{GMS2016} boosted the final PHA completeness for LSST baseline survey by 11\%). 
\end{enumerate} 

Given these systematic effects, a comparison of different simulation results (both for the same system,
and those of different systems, especially systems operating at different wavelengths) has to be undertaken
with due care. It is unlikely that a meaningful quantitative comparison can be pushed beyond a level
of a few percent (and perhaps as much as 10\%). In practice, the completeness of a given operating survey
is best estimated using the object re-discovery rate.
