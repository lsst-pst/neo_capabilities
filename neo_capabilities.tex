\begin{abstract}
We discuss the ability of LSST to contribute to Near-Earth Objects (NEO) discoveries and
the Congressional George E. Brown, Jr. mandate to NASA. The two main issues addressed 
here are the robustness of the LSST strategy for discovering NEOs using nightly pairs of 
observations, and the expected cumulative completeness for potentially hazardous asteroids
(PHAs) with visual absolute magnitudes $H<22$.  We argue that the observing and data 
processing strategies chosen by LSST are robust, and would yield a completeness of about 
70-75\% with the current LSST baseline survey. We describe a number of modifications of the 
LSST baseline survey which potentially could raise the completeness for PHAs with $H<22$
to 90\%, as well as a number of systematic effects that must be taken into account when
comparing different simulations of the same system, as well as simulations of different
systems.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

% 6.1:  Summarize paper 
% 6.2:  Discuss and refute critiques
% 6.3:  Discuss implications of cadence modifications 

{\bf Summary:} Well behaved image differencing and detection are needed for the
asteroid detection strategy adopted by LSST. This has historically
been difficult to achieve. First generation surveys have encountered
significant problems including CCD artifacts, optical system
artifacts, and software issues. Significant progress has been made
since. Contemporary surveys comparable to LSST (specifically, DES) are
already achieving false positive rates below the few:1 ratio required
for LSST MOPS (see next section). LSST image differencing will {\bf
not} be a limiting factor in its ability to discover asteroids
(including NEOs). DES experience has already demonstrated algorithms 
sufficient to meet LSST MOPS requirements.

\begin{enumerate}
\item LSST will employ the 2+2+2 MOPS discovery strategy, and detect fast-moving asteroids via trailing.
\item Existing surveys demonstrate that false positive rates required
  by LSST (approaching $\sim$1:1) are  achievable (Dark Energy Survey;  \citep{goldstein2015}).
\item PanSTARRS PS4 simulations \citep{denneau13}) as well as LSST
  simulations (Myers et al. 2011) demonstrate the ability of MOPS to perform the linkages under those conditions.
\item LSST software and observing strategy are robust to perturbations
  around assumed efficiencies; even large differences in expectation
  cause only a few percent difference in efficiency. 
\item Our simulations indicate that, if the cadence is optimized for
          NEO searches, LSST likely has the capability and capacity to reach the Brown mandate.
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{The JPL-NASA Study}

\cite{JPLstudy} described a new study, related to this work. Their preliminary results indicate a completeness
of $\sim$65\% for NEOs with $H<22$. The difference compared to \cite{JJI2016} result (72\%) is due 
to XXX (true?): PHA vs. NEO, possible slope of the size distribution. 



\subsection{The Grav, Mainzer and Spahr 2016 Study \label{sec:GMS}}

\cite[hereafter GMS]{GMS2016} reported different NEO completeness levels than
published by the LSST team in 2007 and 2014 . There are three main 
reasons why the GMS results differ:
\begin{enumerate}
\item GMS used a different realization of the LSST baseline survey
\item GMS used different synthetic NEO populations to evaluate completeness
\item GMS {\it redefined} the completeness limit from the commonly
  used $H<22$ criterion to an albedo-dependent value of $H$ limit (which
  attempts to directly model the $D>140$ m size cut)
\end{enumerate}

Regarding the last point, GMS found that the completeness drops by 5\%
when $H<22$ criterion is replaced by $D>140$ m criterion. Regarding 
the first point, GMS results can be more meaningfully compared to an LSST
study by \cite{JJI2016}, who used the same simulated cadence. After accounting for 
the $H<22$ vs. $D>140$ m methodological difference of 5\%, GMS obtained a 
completeness of 67\% using 3 pairs in 12 nights (for simulated cadence {\it enigma\_1189}), while Jones et al. 
study obtained $\sim$73\% using 3 pairs in 15 nights (for simulated cadence {\it minion\_1016}, which is 
statistically very similar to {\it enigma\_1189}). This difference 
of $\sim$5\% is attributable to the differences in simulated NEO
populations and other modeling details. In summary, GMS find the NEO
completeness in the range $\sim$60\% to $\sim$70\% for the LSST
baseline cadence. The variation is due to different NEO populations,
different NEO detection criteria, and other specifics. When accounting 
for different choices of simulation parameters, their results are
consistent with the results published by the LSST team. 

But: how much higher can the completeness be pushed with cadence
modifications optimized for NEOs? 

In Observing Strategy white paper: fig. 3.4 gives 73.4\% for PHAs with 
$H<22$ and {\it minion\_1016}, using 3 pairs in 15 nights.

To Do for Lynne:
1) authors
- ask Lori Allen to be coauthor (and if there are others from her team) 
- ask Tim Axelrod and Jonathan Myers (others from old days?) 
- ask OpSim crew to be coauthors? 
- anyone else, e.g. Scott Daniel, Yusra, Peter, etc 


2) text for cadence optimization in Section 5 
- need brief opsim description; can lift some text about opsim from e.g. 



3) read and comment on Sections 1-4
