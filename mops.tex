MOPS: Given the expected false-positive rates demonstrated by
\cite{goldstein15} and in Colin's  section, LSST MOPS linking will
be possible. This has already been shown by the PanSTARRS project 
with simulations performed for the PS4 system\footnote{PanSTARRS 
PS1 experience does not contradict this conclusion. In addition to 
hardware issues, PS1 was only 1/4 of the assumed system; see 
\cite{denneau13} for more details. }, which is in this
respect equivalent to LSST. The robustness to unexpected false
positives is further tested with simulations performed by LSST,
as described below.

Zeljko and Mario. There is a report on MOPS (LDM-156)...   XXX refer to its
results here... 

Quoting \cite{denneau13}: ``MOPS achieves $>$99:5\% efficiency in
producing orbits from a synthetic
but realistic population of asteroids whose measurements were
simulated for a Pan-STARRS4-class telescope. \dots MOPS has been
adapted successfully to the prototype Pan-STARRS1 telescope despite
differences in expected false detection rates, fill-factor loss, and
relatively sparse observing cadence compared to a hypothetical
Pan-STARRS4 telescope and survey.'' 

But we did our own analysis, too...

The LSST project has developed an enhanced prototype implementation of MOPS.
We ran simulations with LSST system and cadence, and a significantly
wider range of false positive candidate rates. 

Known limitations/caveats:
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to computational constraints at the time when the simulation
  was performed (2011), a $v < 0.5$ deg/day velocity limit was
  imposed.
\item For similar reasons, the filters that were imposed on track fitting
  were not optimized, artificially reducing the yield
\item As we understand the algorithmic scalings, these will not change the
final results; nevertheless they are being actively mitigated by new
simulations which are in progress.
\end{itemize}

Simulation results: Asteroids are discoverable in the presence of significant noise.
